# Heap
Heap is a tree based data structure. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)), heap is one maximally efficient implementation of an abstract data type called a priority queue, and in fact, priority queues are often referred to as "heaps", regardless of how they may be implemented.

A min heap has been demonstrated here. Min heap is such a heap where key of a parent is less than or equal to key of child.
